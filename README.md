#  Checklists

## Description
This is an iOS app that follows the tutorials of Raywenderlich's iOS Apprentice. This app enables the user to create a list of checklists and then add to-do items to each list. Due dates are/can be associated with each to-do item.

## Project Status
The first stage of this project was to follow along with the tutorial. In the future, the goal is to add testing around all features and implement a more modular architecture.
